What [STL](data/webpagelist.txt) data structure might be appropriate for producing a set of webpages, given a search word?
As hinted in the previous section, you will likely want to have a WebPage class: what [variables](data/webpagevariables.txt) and functions should this have? At minimum, you will want to track the words in the file, the outgoing links, and the incoming links.
You will likely want a function that is devoted to parsing files and extracting all of the words and links and storing them in sets.
When you parse a file, you can create the set of outgoing links at that time. The set of incoming links may not be known yet, and should be added as you encounter them. A problem you may run into is, when you find an outgoing link, you may not have created the WebPage for that page yet, and so you will not be able to add this as an incoming link yet. How should you handle this? One possible solution would be to create all of the WebPages upfront, and then start parsing.
